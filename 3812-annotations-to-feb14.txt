Reminds me of the song 'Respect' - most of us know it as the signature song of Aretha Franklin but it's actually a heavily reworked cover of an Otis Redding song. If you didn't know Aretha's version was a cover, it'd be difficult to discern they're actually the same song.
This sentence reminded me of a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kyalbr/status/963006419141308417) I came across recently. I've also added a page note to the thread itself.  
Museums in Western civilizations like to display artifacts from other civilizations as evidence they're cultured and refined, but somehow don't recognize the civilizations themselves for what they are. By moving these artifacts into the sterilized environment of the museum, with space between each item and a handy identifying tag, it objectifies a culture without requiring the viewer to actually engage with the context of the artifacts.
There's always that old joke that the British Museum houses thousands of artifacts, a few dozen of which even belong to them...  But more seriously, bringing an artifact into a museum context is already alienating it from the purpose for which it was originally created for. While I whole-heartedly agree that the Elgin Marbles should be returned to Athens, how much does returning an artifact to a museum in its home country do to restore the context it belongs in?
Is the medieval workshop analogy appropriate because the tools being used are "basic" or is it appropriate because we don't necessarily have any idea what we're doing?  What makes a tool basic? Is it necessary for us to always use "cutting edge" technology if the "basic" version does the same thing?
It's a perspective I've considered before and something like this was discussed a bit in my History of the Future class last semester.  In the context of that class, we were talking about the way science fiction developed but it applies to conservation too. In science fiction, the types of technological advancements that are incorporated into the "future" that's presented is a reflection of what we see in our present today.   In the context of archaeology and conservation, it's easy to think we're talking about the past, because what needs conservation work is things from the past. But when we choose to preserve items from the past, we are projecting present day values on it. We don't preserve items based on their value or worth when they were being used, we preserve based on their value or worth in today's society. When Pompeii was discovered, people only cared about statuary and it led to situations like the courtyard Professor Graham was trying to digitally restore that he showed us in class. However, today we think the entire place is valuable and are choosing to preserve more than just statues. 
Oh? Show me.
Make it so!  ![Make it so](https://i.giphy.com/bKnEnd65zqxfq.gif)  
Extend this into our own work now...
...and who defines 'misuse'? 
Extend the ethics into digital simulacra...
Good question. Should everything from the 'past' be saved?
alright: why is it interesting? what in particular strikes you? where's the connections with things you've already read?
Yes, this happens in music all the time! An artist will use a beat, hook, or something else from another artists piece of music and more often than not, the original artist would appreciate it and enjoy the remix. I remember when 'Anaconda' by Nicki Minaj came out and I was thinking "Hm? I wonder what Sir-Mix-a-lot would think about that" (since his beat and sound were the basis of the song). I believe in an interview he said he enjoyed the song.  
Although this is a true statement. You can also argue that the copy (if done in a fair manner with credit to the original) would bring more conversation to the piece and will be able to further increase it's popularity. Love to hear what other think of this!
This is something cool here! What this little quote is essentially saying (from my own understanding) are that since objects are so open and so avaliable for the public to see and interpret, it makes them vulnerable for misuse and misinterpretation.
I agree, this truly is an interesting concept that not many people think about but it's important to note of course!
I like this idea. Instead of keeping things in (such as the model of Nefertiti that was taken without permission), museums now have the opportunity to give out to the world. Of course, more ethical questions come about thinking about what people can do with the models they gain from the museum.. similar to how Prof. Graham talked about getting students websites to which they can freely use. "But what if they use the website for xxxxx?". I believe freedom of expression is important, and we should embrace the use of 3D-models, whatever they may be. Just some food for thought! 
This reminds me slightly of remixes of songs. For example, All Along The Watchtower is best known by Jimmy Hendrix; however, originally by Bob Dylan. Did Dylan feel like he lost that piece of originality? Nope, instead he felt the opposite. He felt like he gave something that was 'perfected', and he seemed quite pleased that someone was able to take what he made and make it better.   https://www.quora.com/What-did-Bob-Dylan-say-after-he-heard-Jimi-Hendrixs-version-of-All-Along-the-Watchtower .   This quote further shows my point, that Hendrix was able to remix something and take it one step further. 
Thats the beauty of copying/remixing, the limit is only imagination. A simple piece of something can be altered, shaped, mashed, etc. any number of times. Different meanings appear each time, so remixing is an art-form in itself. 
Love this quote because its so true. Always have to be mindful of it when dealing with history
I believe this brings up a great point. Similar to past talks we've had, a physical object you interact with may have more meaning; therefore, how does translating the feeling (in this case, the issues revolve around looting) conserve that negative aspect? Does it at all? Or has conserving the model washed away the guilt.
The idea of an emergency room makes it sound like we're trying to 'save' something. Does it need saving? The medieval workshop is proper because I believe the tools we use are still pretty basic for conservation. 
Goes back to the idea of remixing, where you can take something that has been old, and adding something new to it, turning it into something that is completely different.
You can also look at how the people now get to choose what pieces they may reconstruct, therefore changing the history which we may know for future generations.
To get a bit more incite on this we could look at the casts of the dead bodies done that were made in Pompeii, and whether these people would have wanted their bodies, or the casts of their bodies to end up in a museum.
"History is written by the victors"
This is intriguing, because to look at an object this way, it would give it 2 stories, one of what the object was and the other of how it was attained, though people dont always like to talk about how certain artifacts were found.
This is a really interesting way to look at this, i have never thought about it in those terms before
This is definitely not an absolute fact, there has been countless examples of architecture that has been completely original in design. 
His "The Stones Of Venice" makes a good companion to a lot of this reading, for anyone interested.
I feel like this question was already answered in what I hear of as architecture's "postmodern" phase, in which older elements were often "mashed up" with newer designs to create buildings that put different times and spaces in dialogue. The success of this, of course, will probably depend on who you ask and what you think it was trying to achieve...
This again, from the core concept readings...
Very important point. I find it easiest to imagine when I bring it back to music, in the sense of hip-hop and remixes. Trip-hop artist Tricky and modern pop singer Alessia Cara have both created songs based heavily around the same sample of an old Isaac Hayes song, but their contexts lend it entirely different feelings for each of their songs.
I remember reading somewhere something about the monks of Medieval times copying ancient texts, but also adding their own comments in the margins, some of which came to be included in later editions if they were deemed interesting enough. Also, all of these things could be potentially thought of as "remixes".
I can't honestly claim to be able to situate this in the framework we previously covered to do with the permeability/permanence of objects, but it strikes me as something someone could try and classify as such, if they were interested.
One thing that strikes me about the possibility of altering copies of objects once they're digitized is that I believe it does actually have potential to threaten the "supremacy of the original". A sort of "thought experiment" for this: if we digitize ancient marble statues and "restore" their painted colours in subsequent copies (like 3D-printed models), then teach future generations that these coloured versions are closer to what the statues would have looked like in their original contexts, what reason would the new generation have to value the older marble versions more? They would now appear less accurate to them, and the status of their "originality" might disappear from the public eye over time.
They are all formed with specific motivations as to what to preserve, why and for what purposes. Shawn covered a similar angle in class on the uses of plaster cast collections for art/history education in Europe.
I also think the use of the word "activate" is really interesting here. Tied to your comment on the ownership of the artifact, it's seen as something "static" and unchanging within the museum as long as it is the property of that particular place. But allowing it to be subject to "change" through this scanning can potentially destabilize both notions of ownership and of an essential "static nature".
I think the ability to be able too see an artifact in different forms or see it reconstructed can potentially offer historians valuable information. The edges of broken pottery shards can tell us how pot was fired, while a full reconstruction can show us how the pot was used and for what. 
As we have discussed, even technology cannot be relied upon to be permanent. While archaeologists can recreate artifacts and sites digitally to preserve them, they must also be aware of the programs they are using and keep them up  to date, because one day the software company they are using might go  under and all of their preservation may be lost. 
This not a unique issue either. for quite some time there has been ongoing debate about which countries should "own" a historical artifact, the one it was found in or the country that funded the dig. the most famous and debated issue of this sort are about the Elgin marbles (sculptures from the Parthenon). while the were recovered and brought back to England more than 2 centuries ago and have remained in the UK since, there has been notable push back to have them returned to their rightful place in Athens. This is a popular example although I'm sure there are an abundance of cases just like it. It Makes you question how ethically some of the worlds most famous artifact were discovered and displayed. 
It seems like the artists are reclaiming this bust's history and autonomy. By being in a German museum, the bust is already  removed from its native context and country, and the way in which it was acquired in the first place is questionable. But by releasing the 3D data of the bust, its rejects the notion of ownership in regards to historical artifacts. 
I thought of this Twitter thread when doing today's reading (Sam Jacob article), particularly when I got to this quote: "The power of owning objects, of displaying them, is the power over cultural narrative, the narrative of "the victors" as Churchill put it."
This reminds me of many of the busts I saw at the Art Institute of Chicago. Here is an example: ![](http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/135997?search_no=5&index=40)

The class looks like it's gonna be a blast of fun, and new learning experiences. It's also not what I expected at all, I was expecting a history class on digital things, not the other way around. pleasantly surprised!
Consider THIS PHRASE annotated.
I am looking forward to exploring how my understanding of history can be challenged
for this exercise, it was just about figuring out how to use the hypothesis service - which you can do! So now, as you read (whether 'official' readings or tutorials or whatever) you can leave comments to yourself, engage with your peers, mark up the text as you see fit... click where it says 'hist3812w2018' on an annotation, and you can see what everyone else is up to...
it's all an experiment, right? document everything.
ah, but you figured it out!
y'only missed the one class, which was all about the philosophy of the course. read through this site, and the core philosophy papers, and you'll be fine.
Combining studies in archiving, history and philosophy is an interesting prospect to me, and it might even be relevant to my later plan to go on to a Masters in Library/Information Science. My main concern is that I've started this course a little late since I dropped another one in favor of it, so I have a bit of catching up to do!
Well that took a while to figure out.... 
üëçüëçüëç
I am worried because I don't know what I should write here.  But I look forward to participating and thinking! 
but look at you, you're already using an annotation layer on the open web! you can do this, you can do everything else!
no, you're doing great!
"I think I finally figured this thing out!" he said, lying through his teeth.
I'm intrigued with this course, and new ways of learning. I like the idea of experiments and going through a process, despite the outcome. I'm worried that I won't be able to use some of the digital tools, because I am not entirely tech-savvy. I hope to create new things and make mistakes I can learn from as I go along in this class. Can't wait to 3D print!!! 
I am definitely intrigued and intimidated by this course so far. There is a lack of understanding on my part with regards to the use of the online platforms. I feel that I am slowly getting the hang of it now and I am very exited to become more familiarized with the online tools for this class. Judging from Professor Graham's website and the content of the first lecture, it seems that this course will provide me with a great opportunity to improve many skills that are currently underdeveloped and allow me to look at a very different perspective of history. I am excited for the experience ahead.
if you check what a lot of museums are up to these days, there is a *lot* of interest in AR, VR, photogrammetry and so on. Check out what they're doing at CSTM!
I'm mostly just interested in what this class was going to be! I had no idea what to expect, but that it might be helpful for a future career in museum work which is what I've been looking into lately. 
You might give this a try - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) as a way of keeping things under control
It's all about the journey, the process, the things that break...
And of course, you'll be able to bring what you learned in hist3814 to bear!
Well, as I told folks on the first day, this course is an experiment and even I am not sure where it'll lead.  That's what makes university fun, right?
Getting the hang of things - it's the journey that matters here, so as long as you document the ups and downs of getting to grips with all these ideas, you'll be fine!
You might find it a good idea to schedule time right now for you to work on the various tasks this course requires. I set aside blocks of time every week to write, for instance, or to do emails, or to just futz with new tech... Thought I don't do this, folks tell me it works for them [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
There will be a lot of work, I won't lie to you. *But*, it'll be interesting, meaningful work! Work that will push you to think of history in new ways, and you will never look at computers the same way again...
I can't wait for this course (even if I forgot to set this up until today #oops). I love history and computer science/programming, so I'm excited to FINALLY be in a course where I get to do both. Technology is awesome, and I wish it were embraced more in history classes. Also anything video game related is great :) My biggest concern is just getting the work done, as I am a huge procrastinator and work irregular hours. In any case, I'm hoping this will be fun and can't wait to learn more!
Having a history with digital humanities, I am interested in broadening my understand of the digital and electronic realm of digital studies. It'll be interesting to see how the readings will benefit our discussions and in return, affect our projects.  It may be difficult getting a hang of all the tools and resources, but will be a nice learning activity.
I am very excited for this course! I am really looking forward to learning how to perceive history in new digital ways. I think that the course will challenge me, but I am hopeful that I can adapt.
I was not 100% sure coming into this course exactly what I would be getting myself into, but from what I can tell I am in for a fun little journey. I can't wait!
It's a wee bit of writing I have you do at the start of class. 2-3 lines on a cue card is fine. Even better if you have it done before you come to class. It's just a bit of text from the readings or a peer's annotation that strikes you as interesting for some reason - we'll use these to kick off discussions and explorations.
I am really excited to try out a class that is completely different from typical university lecture classes. However, I am slightly concerned about all of the applications and technologies that we are acquired to use as I am unfamiliar with them all and it may take some time to get the hang of. I am certain that once this  challenge is overcome, the skills i had acquired will be very valuable to me in the future. 
I'm still confused about what exactly entry tickets are? I assume it'll be clarified in class but maybe I'm not the only one that still doesn't quite get it.
I'm super excited for this class because it sounds really interesting but I'm also really concerned because I describe myself as "an aggressive procrastinator" and it's bitten me in behind quite a lot, especially this past fall semester, and it looks like the schedule for work for this class is pretty tight. Nevertheless, I'm excited to start on Monday!  From the annotations that are here so far at least I'm not the only procrastinator in the class...
I am excited for this class because it seems completely modern with technology. I am slightly worried that it'll be a lot of work; however, it is wonderful that i have complete faith that i will learn lots. Using so many tools is weird, considering many teachers still only use books and no online resources. This is wonderful in the long run. I love the idea of embracing history and the digital world. 
By this, I mean, use one, two, or even three of these tags to categorize the nature of your annotation. For instance, maybe there's something in the schedule that is confusing. You might make an annotation there and highlight it with the tag 'worrying'.  Or you might find something that totally floats your boat: 'wonderful'!  You're welcome to use other tags, too, of course. If you click on the tags, what happens?  ![keanu](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/54575039/woah.jpg)
Everyone comes to this course with a different starting point. But what's fun - what's cool - is pushing yourself further than you thought you'd go! 
It's ok to be nervous! I want this course to push you in ways you hadn't thought of before. You've already seen how essay writing fosters historical thinking; now you're having the chance to see how other ways of 'making' interface with history!
I am excited to learn a lot of new skills this semester because I have not worked with any of these websites before. It will definitely be challenging but I think this will be one of the most useful courses that I have taken at Carleton. So often in history courses we are simply reading and writing but with this course we are able to expand our knowledge beyond that. This is something that I am most excited about. I am concerned that I am "biting off more than I can chew" since everything is new to me but that is all part of the journey
I am slightly concerned about this course because it uses a lot of skills and tools that I don't have or don't know how to use. Nevertheless, I am excited to learn these skills and to learn to use these tools. I think it will be interesting to really focus on a single historical artifact or site, and delve into its history and different ways to perceive it. 
I completely agree. Mash ups are vital for creating something new while still giving a nod to the old
The fact that there are no set "rules" in aesthetic taste makes everything incredibly confusing when we try to categorize/attribute boundaries to work.  I wish I had an answer/opinion but it just kind of makes my brain hurt to think about because there is no one correct way to approach this. I guess choose the approach that is less problematic? That's not a very satisfying conclusion though...
Reminds me about how every corporate marketing team strives to make a "viral" marketing ad without really knowing what makes viral videos interesting/good/viral.
Reoccurring trend both in history and within this course. Whenever anything new happens, there always seems to be backlash by the established order. I think we should remind ourselves that just because there is backlash about something, it does not mean it is bad. In this case, even though the backlash was severe (lawsuit) their work was awesome/revolutionary!
This is very interesting because there is always the idea that the older the art work is, the more "original" and special it is. Artworks made in modern day aren't held up to the same status as praise as the past and this could be seen with paintings or even music where numerous people argue that they are simply remade from an old song
I find this logic funny because it seems to deny the fact that bands often play the same songs they have practiced  over and over and over again. The only difference between the content of live performance and recording isn't that its programmed, its that we get to see the flaws in the programming when we go to a show.
Hard to agree with, what is considered "new" is solely relative to what we already know about a piece, we may think we know everything about the contents of a recording but other information may arise that completely shifts the way we view the work. 
Seems to be an example of technological determinism 
Hilariously true. Crazy how the digital revolution has completely revamped something so important to society and history as music, over the last few decades.
This is an interesting point that I think somewhat tied into the previous discussion of value that we had in class. What makes something original and authentic is it the idea, the product, etc. then with value the question is what makes something valuable the actual product or the idea behind it. 
I actually believe the opposite of this quote. Mash ups to me show a way of how you can take two things that are old and making them into something completely new. This ends up giving you a whole new perspective of it all.
I feel like this can be thought of in the way that you are taking two very different forms of music usually that would not have gone together and making them into one entity which is completely different.
I love everything about this. It sounds as if there wasn't a decision to mix two songs up, and more like they fell together without a reason.
Just an interesting concept to think about
I look at this in the sense that it is okay for something to go mainstream, but you still need it to stay true to what it originally was and not just let it be molded into what corporations want it to be. When that happens the music loses it's true essence.
best description ever of Mashups, that is all
In response to the comment about recorded music allowing more people to experience listening to it: Is the purest form of an Iron Maiden song (for example) hearing the band play live or hearing a recorded version of it? Its designed, recorded, and optimized in the studio to be listened to as a recording, is listening to it live a less pure form of that? Or more pure?
Is this true of all media capturing? Seems to me that often times if something is being recorded it cannot be as pure of an event as if it occurred without any recording devices present
I wont argue that some recordings are vastly inferior to live performances; however, I believe that it does not ruin the music itself. Instead, it allows more audiences to experience the medium. Not everyone in the world can go watch an Iron Maiden concert live, but anyone and everyone can experience the music through recording.
I wonder if people take this technology for granted? How often do people actually think of this history while they work using it? I believe digital history to be special in that many people work with technology while having little to no understanding of how it works
Interesting how this could translate with digital history. On the topic of copies, perhaps the "not-allowed" copies are more rebellious and therefore more popular among certain demographics? 
Article that I came across on Facebook about what "smart" homes look like now. It reminded me of when Professor Graham said in class that so much of our data from our devices is being sent somewhere to create profiles of us. Kashmir makes a point at the end that her smart devices could lose capabilities through automatic software updates.
This passage prompts the question, is anything really original these days?  With all the remixes in this "Cut and Paste Culture" creativity is determined more by ones ability to have an original mixture than it is by ones ability to come up with something original.  
It is interesting how the music industry has shifted so that the live performance is no longer considered the original and the recording is. How do you decided which version is the original? Is it the first time the singer sang the song or the first time they recorded it? and how do you recreate the original in that case, is every version after a copy?
This is interesting, as the original is the only thing which gives the copy meaning. Without the original being known, the copy isn't recognizably a copy, and thus doesn't fulfill the same purpose as intended in creating a mash-up.
I feel that most people are resistant to change, and as a result there are always people who are against new forms of technology as they see it as unnecessary to change the way things are done. 
This definitely applies to the emphasis we have when studying history from a Eurocentric perspective on written history. I know a lot of people who criticize and think of other forms of history such as oral history as "lesser" and more unreliable but don't stop to think how the writer of a primary source document may also be influenced by external forces to present an event in a certain light.
This article makes a hard distinction between a recording and a live performance, so I'm curious how Gunkel considers "live" recordings and livestreamed concerts/events that later release the recorded version of the event.
I think knowing music is coming via ads and other promotions might increase expectations? You can't anticipate illegal/unauthorized music because the musicians won't shout about it the way "legitimate" music is advertised at you. It's possible people expected something as good as, or even better, than the original "illegal" version and were disappointed.
A simulation is an imitation. An important note on simulations is that they don't try to recreate or to be the original; therefore, the simulation cannot derive from the original, as Gunkel states. 
Derrida was mentioned in my Literary Theory class and this section reminds me of Post-Structuralist literary theory. Post-structuralism is the theory that signification is always deferred and that the reader is critical in terms of how meaning is constructed. Although the text will always say the same thing, it will not always mean the same thing. 
I find this interesting because one of the things I do a lot in this class is look at what the original means in different contexts. I do not believe that there is one true original, but I am interested in how the idea of the original shapes our understanding of a thing.
Does innovation have to continually be innovative or can it be innovate for a period of time? I think that an innovation is only innovative for a period of time, but it breaks the ground so that people can be innovative in other, new ways. It might seem less impressive as new innovations are made, but that does not detract from the fact that an innovation broke new ground. 
I wonder if critics regarded this version as less interesting because it was "less interesting" or because it was "authorized". Is it the subversion of authority or the art that is more interesting? I think the success of the albums are determined by what the audience gets out of it, whether or not that was the original intention. 
This is what makes remixing important and is similar to what we are expected to do in Module 2, and that is to make something that makes us rethink our object or look at in in a different way. 
I see the point that the author is trying to make but i feel as though the pop music that they are talking about was made specifically to be repetitive so that it is catchy and I dont think that there was much thought put into preserving the spontaneity of a performance. Furthermore, many listeners may prefer recorded versions because they sound different or better than a live performance from that singer. I can see this argument being applied to more complex, well written, or emotional music, but in the context of catchy pop music I dont know how much it applies or how much it matters?
Belief that the original is more valuable than a copy ] because we give more meaning to it and authenticity plays a big role in our perception of it. 
I think, in this case, remix's success is determined based of what it was trying to  achieve. While MTV's CD was less interesting, i think their ultimate goal was most likely to make a lot of sales and money, in which they succeeded. The Grey Album, however, was made to make a statement and profit was not the main intention, so in its own right it was successful. 
I tried to check this out on youtube and a good number of relevant videos were still blocked or removed for copyright strikes.


pay attention here folks...
This sounds like something really fun and creative to do, and I think it's a really interesting way to approach archaeological elements from a different angle. 
The question of how and why the photos were taken in particular ways also raises the question of how to the photographs change that which they are capturing. Does she really know what she is changing or photobashing?
This sounds a lot like the processes we're aiming to do with Module 2.
I started thinking about this album again Monday after class because I am super fond of it, but also the performative aspect that plays heavily into the experience of Spin Cycle, which is what this album is called.   It's relevant because of the way it's put together. The Afiara Quartet approached Canadian composers and had them compose pieces for them. Skratch Bastid then took the recorded versions of those pieces and remixed them. They then sent the remixed versions back to the original composers, who then wrote a response to the remix for the Afiara Quartet to play with the remixed version. Every time they perform it it's a little bit different because Skratch Bastid mixes it live and thus it sounds different every time. It's definitely an interesting way to look at music, especially classical music. I think a lot of people have this idea of classical music being very stoic and unapproachable, but I find Spin Cycle is very open and easier to digest because it's very clearly a dialogue between the very classical form of the quartet speaking to the very modern concept of scratch DJ and remixing.  If anyone is interested, the pieces they play in the video are: 2 Pop Songs on Antique Poems: No. 2, I Will Not Let You Go, composed by Dinuk Wijeratne Soul Searching, Pts. 1 & 2 (Skratch Bastid remix) Through the Invisible, composed by Dinuk Wijeratne [this is the piece Wijeratne composed in response to the remix]  I have a physical copy of the album, and it's also on Spotify if that's an app you use. 
The ethics question is important to look at due to the fact that you are still taking dead bodies in a sense, taking away from the privacy of them. Though there is no actual body, it is the same idea as if you were to take a photo scan of someone body without their knowing and make 3D replicas of them.
It is interesting to look and see how the absence of what was there could be more important than whatt was actually there to begin with.
Are these really archaelogical casts then, or more just are pieces because they are copies of copies?
It iss interesting to see how the views of the casts changed over time, going from historical pieces, to more of just a fancy piece to have and then back to its original historical view. 
to answer this question, one would have to define what they consider to be a work of art. The Definition is certainly fluid, and the answer may honestly depend on the individuals opinion. While filling in the voids with plaster may not seem creative, the idea of it was certainly smart, and the process is quite delicate as well. 
Copies of copies. Its incredible how everyone goes to museums to see the original artifact/artwork, and yet, we are so unaware of the many items that are reconstructions, or have been altered. 
A fascinating moral dilemma to contend with. While I initially thought that the plaster casts of the victims on Mt Vesuvius were actually people, and many do contain the remains of the victims, the space itself is a mere copy of what was once there. The plaster casts are still on display to the public, which is also kind of eerie to think about. I can't say i have an answer to the authors question but it is certainly thought provoking none the less.
I think what I was referring to here was specifically the question that I highlighted. I agree that making the casts does expand upon the potential knowledge we could have of the bodies of the victims (though there are limiting factors in this too). But the kind of question they're asking here has presented us with only two options: either the casts are artefacts or works of art. Neither option necessarily views the casts as the "bodies" of the victims, which I think the article is trying to get us to recognize. At least, this is my interpretation as to why this question is asked.
Much like the destroyed Roman site in Syria in the article by Beale and Reilly, context is a lot more fluid than one might think. It's important to look at the entire picture and how these reincarnations and replicants are portraying certain narratives, or if they are ignoring others.
Would the actual casts be representing the victims or the empty space which the cast were made from that is not visible anymore represent the victims?
I agree and disagree with you on this point, because yes you could look at it as limiting what it is, but making the casts also produces archaeological evidence which would not have been known before hand
The question here inherently sets limits on what the thing in question can be. This is perhaps something to watch out for in the digitalizing process, perhaps occurring in instances where the technology ends up guiding the purpose.
I seem to remember reading a little bit about how Whitehead's "process philosophy" has a conception of being more in-line with a constantly shifting nature rather than any kind of fixed one - definitely seems relevant to this course.
The volcanic eruption that brought death to the victims of Pompeii, also preserved their ontological existence as living molds of historic life.  Much like people frozen in ice, they have become a natural snapshot of what life was like in the past. 
Interesting. How would you fit - or can you fit? - 'event' voids into his framework?
Another example of the process being just as valuable/telling about history than the end result
I know this article is about "physical" voids in material, but I think the critical thinking it describes also relates to "event" voids (for lack of a better term) as well. As in, sometimes the absence of something happening is more telling to us as historians. 
This article contains a very useful framework for us to understand some of the potential _meanings_ of our digital models. 
Confusingly, there is a quote after this word in the pdf that does not appear here...I wanted to make a note on it, so I suppose I'll have to reproduce some of the quote here for it: McLeod claims in it that mashups rely on "the recognizability of the original" and are drawn from the "narrow repertoire of top 40 pop songs". This, however, is not always the case in "remix culture"; much of hip-hop production is built on musical arrangements constructed from several short samples of very obscure musical works, sometimes deliberately made less recognizable to avoid lawsuits - and James Joyce's "Finnegan's Wake" couldn't possibly be built of what we would consider to be "recognizable" sources, could it? (I know the latter is a book and not music, but the theory should hold reasonably well across media)
There's something funny about this being quoted out of context...
This point strikes me as potentially compatible with Roland Barthes's "Death Of The Author" theory, in that no one "author" of any "text" can claim to be its "originator" because creativity is simply the process of the spread of cultural influence through various "creators".
Not much of an "academic" note, but I highly recommend this, for anyone interested in messing around with audio; the pop artist tUnEyArDs recorded two whole albums using only this program to create a lot of fascinating manipulations of her voice and other instruments.
This has a history that extends back further - there is a whole practice in jazz of "quoting" melodies from other songs in the midst of improvised solos (interestingly, this is particularly popular in "live" performances), and I remember reading that some composers like Tchaikovsky would incorporate "quotes" from popular Russian folk songs into his symphonies.
This seems to be a heavily glossed over point. It appears that much of the reading and discussion is about how technology has changed archeology, not how archeological methods have changed with technology. Unfortunately it seems like a "one step forward, two steps back" with the re-assimilation like EPetrie mentions below.
I feel like the limit of technology in general is always being pushed to higher boundaries as society are constantly developing new programs and technology. This could be seen with the very definition of what you would consider technology and the way it has evolved over time.  
As technology advances, so to does the possibilities for its interaction with various fields.  
To quote the iconic Cady Heron, "the limit does not exist". Or, at the very least, we should be looking for new ways to incorporate virtual archaeology and improve upon it when we do reach technological limits 
I also think that virtual reality can have many positive effects. It can, in one way, increase our engagement with the world by letting us view an archaeological site or historic ruins without having to physically travel there, and yet, it can perhaps satisfy our need to view these places and discourage us from visiting the actual site. While the experience for the viewer is not quite the same, this option could be beneficial to archaeologists because they can not only share their discoveries, but the limitations of human traffic can help the preservation of theses sites . (As an example, i think about Pompey, which is a massive tourist site and is struggling to maintain their archaeological discoveries in the wake of constant human traffic and tourist interaction)
I find this point very interesting too. Perhaps this is because the creators see their work as art (as mentioned in the passage) or a creative en devour, rather than a factual historical analysis and they want to be able to take credit for their work and have recognize their individual interpretation. I think in regards to virtually rendering history and archaeology, it is important to acknowledge that the object being viewed is a recreation, and that both machine and humans worked to create the copy, ultimately losing some aspect of its subjectivity. 
I believe that technology has intervened with the way most people view or engage with archaeology. It stimulating and for most tech-savvy people nowadays, easier to navigate and practice. It changes the experience of archaeology.
with all the new technology such as 3D viewing and other such technological advancements, it is true that the way we are able to perceive archaeology at this point is changing, and giving it a wider audience.
I think this relates back to the unfortunate re-assimilation of "pre-existing traditions of field recording practices and their epistemological assumptions"  to new technologies, mentioned earlier in the text. It is important to look at how we use technologies and the traditions that have shaped these uses in order to stimulate innovation and ensure that practices have not been founded on outdated traditions. 
I find it interesting that they are actually seeking subjectivity. Most of the time it seems that people like to seem objective and deny any subjectivity or bias in relation to historical analyses. 
This quote made me think of the charts that we looked at during Monday's class! Just because something is digital does not mean that it is permanent 
We must be aware of the ways the technology we adopt impacts our methods, and vice-versa.
Often heritage projects are more sustainable if the local community is highly involved in the process.  It fosters a sense of ownership and personal investment. 
I think that this, as a minor theme in the writing, is really powerful. Combating the ambivalence of people towards digital projects, and humanising and making accessible the product is an important step which will probably shape how historians act in the future.
I think it means "beyond inclusion" as "going further than but also including inclusion" if that makes more sense. Its referencing while its goals include inclusion it goes further by also examining "opportunities and implications of digital visualisation technologies for community engagement and research."
I also think the internet is providing us with the unique opportunity to revisit those standards and see if they still apply to modern practices. 
This idea is really interesting, because not only did they get the communities to get the information, but they showed them what to do with it afterwards
This quote i find can be related to a lot of scholarly material that is produced. Finding a way to bring people who may not be in a certain field or even in school in general can bring about a different way of showing the information to others. As well with having someone who may or may not be in the scholarly sphere, they think about things differently, which if you are faced with problems, could give you ways of solving them that you would not normally go about doing.
I like that they got community involvement in deciding this, but it also can be potentially limiting. After all, what we think is significant to preserve now could be totally different than even a couple years from now.
Interesting as a way to engage more people and get new perspectives on history and archaelogy. I like it!
This is particularly interesting because I think my involving the community to chose the monuments it's modernizing the monuments meaning. It gives the monument a dual-meaning of whatever it was in the past with its significance, and newer one to connect to the modern day.
The range of possibilities to be found in digital humanities is one of the biggest draws for me to the field. I think that the combination of new technologies and more 'traditional' areas of study allows for an endless amount of interesting projects and results.
I think this is really important, as there is a key aspect of heritage which relies on human knowledge and being able to pass down stories and information through generations. In including the communities, it widens the scope of heritage preserved.
Community involvement is definitely important, but when it comes to focus groups I have a lot of questions. When are these focus groups held, and what kind of people are able to attend these focus groups? Do they only hold one or do they hold a few to increase the diversity of people able to attend?
I don't understand how examining "opportunities and implications of digital visualisation technologies for community engagement and research" goes beyond inclusion. Surely by engaging the community, you're practising inclusion?
Professionalization in the past was largely to create uniform standards across a given industry for process and documentation, but with the internet now as long as we state what the standards are anyone with internet access can adhere to them.
This paradox of objectivity and creative engagement in the process of recording heritage is interesting. We want both the process and the result to be both engaging and objective. In many ways this does not make sense, but in looking at the process of recording heritage and the interesting and innovative projects that result from the use of technologies, somehow this paradox just works. 
I agree with your statement. I think having the community involved in local projects, alongside experts is important to fully understand an artifact. This raises a question posed earlier in the introduction (and I am paraphrasing when I write): if everyone has the capacity to be an archaeologist, why do we need experts? I think having the community participate in such projects is important because they have an understanding of the local culture and history that an expert might not and their inexperience can bring innovation; however, I also think that experts are needed to guide the project and to set a standard. 
A clear, real world example of why logging our process is essential. Sometimes the journey is more fascinating than the final product. 
I think that involving the community directly is essential for this work in order to fully understand the importance and relevance of an artifact.
Aka "us" as digital historians, in this case.
Its clear what the advantages of reading artifacts in 3D are, that we are able to see something perhaps on the other end of the world in our hands to study. The other advantage that reflects the mission of digital humanists is the preservation of these artifacts by being uploaded digitaly: if we are ever to lose it, we can now reproduce a copy of its original state.  The implications of this project is how easily these things can be reproduced and examined. 
I think it also provides really interesting opportunities to research how people interact with historical artifacts. For example, often in modelling the context of an artifact can be lost to the point like, deformations due to snow on a statue during modelling are seen as original pieces of the work simply because that is how individuals may first encounter the object. Reminds me of the white statutes that were originally painted. 
how do you think re-evaluating old artifacts could change people's views of the people who had found them. what if with the new technology it also showed us an entirely different view of a culture or group. would this end up changing history as we know it?
Not entirely related, but the layered block at the beginning of the video reminded me of these: [Omoshiroi Block](http://www.spoon-tamago.com/2018/01/12/omoshiro-block/)
You're totally right; they were excited to use 3d tech and didn't know what to do with it. But (my interpretation at least) is that that was the point. They didn't know what they were going to do with 3d tech so they were experimenting to try to figure it out. This basic model isn't useful on its own, but it is useful as a stepping stone to lead to more useful/practical/better applications. Granted, I may be totally wrong but thats my takeaway anyways!
I like how they illustrate the potential for technology for us to explore new interpretations of things. Makes us question what we think we know about history/archaeology, as we discussed in class "facts" and interpretations of events are often very subjective! Hopefully with new technology we can not only discover new things but reevaluate old ones to be more accurate.
It could just be me not understanding, but it seems like someone was more excited about using the 3D tech than they knew what to do with it. I just don't see the point
I think the idea of preservation of record is nice; it allows us to maintain historical and archaeological sites and, perhaps, learn from them in the future when better technology is available to analyze these sites. However, the author notes that these records are often superficial. In preserving the site, one is able to dismiss a certain level of proof, which might be gained through archaeology, and rely on conventions and expectations. It seems that we must always give something up to gain something else. 
I think this quote is really important. It can be related directly to our models that we are creating now. We are working to defy what it means to create digital history (as this is always expanding and changing as technology changes.) Using virtual archaeology to not only analyze the past and present but also as a way to assess the future is something extremely interesting and important.
I think for any discipline to be able to grow, it needs to be open minded to applying new perspectives and techniques to elements within the discipline. Technology has changed the way many different things work, and has allowed for a lot of innovation within humanities disciplines. 
The fact that archaeology requires the destruction of certain levels of a site, in order to reach older artifacts and levels, has always been something I've struggled with. While important and interesting historical sites are discovered through digging, there's a significant part of me that hates the idea of destroying any aspect of history. I like the idea of be able to preserve what has been destroyed through technology a lot. 
It's a good question, and it's harder yet when you have the different cultures who hold different values. Syrians, Italians, and the world at large could have very different views of which is the most valuable, and each should have a say in how, or in which medium, the site should be reconstructed.
Omg this is so cool! As we develop even more materials the prints will be even more accurate. Although, this also means they'll likely be less permanent/more subject to decay. 
This made me think about EPetrie's comment about the value of an original, with 3D printing you can manipulate objects into a shape of of your choice, it makes you wonder  if the original is worth preserving or do these alterations make things easier to work with/understand...
would this mean that they would be able to change the form of the object that has already been created?
I think this goes back to previous readings and discussions about the value of an original. Both a 3D restoration of the site and the preservation of the original site hold some element of the original, while also changing the construction of the original, but which do we value more? 
with paintings so easy to replicate it is true that keeping that true "aura" is only able to be done with the original version
This sense of aura that the originals hold is interesting in the fact that it comes about not from how the painting looks, but more what the painting was and what the painting is.
This passage can be applied to the Terry fox Statue that is situated in front of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. The pose that was chosen for that statue has been replicated in many other pieces of art and several other statues and monuments around Canada.  The Statues all share the iconic image of Terry Fox persevering on his marathon of hope.  The image that the statues depict will constantly be referenced in times when Canadians need to come together, as Terry Fox's journey from St. Johns to Thunder Bay is often considered the first uniting moment for the people Canada. The original essence of Terry Fox's spirit has become immortalized in the statues that replicate his legacy. 
I think Stephen Greenblatt has written some articles on this idea of the "proper" context for the display of historical objects, tied to his writing about "new historicism". I'd have to dig back to remember what exactly he said though.
What would we consider to be limits of these restorations? It would probably be considered absurd to, say, "restore" the arms of the Venus de Milo, but isn't this just repairing the statue from the damage it suffered over time as well? Of course, digital modeling allows for different opportunities in this respect, and perhaps we could simply "restore" the arms of the statue in a digital version to see what it might have looked like...
The concept of artwork having an 'aura' is really recognizable to me through my experience with art. I find the idea of trying to define this as very interesting, as I personally believe that everyone reacts differently to artwork and the 'aura' of a certain work may be felt by some in a facsimile while others may identify it in the 'original'. 
The environment in which one views an artwork greatly influences their experience and reaction to the work. Viewing an image of an artwork on a slide in a classroom is very different from seeing it in a museum. The atmosphere of the museum or gallery creates a sense of awe, and works to display the artwork as something to be revered. Though the way the museum is set up plays a big role in how the work is perceived.
There is definitely a sense of trust with institutions we regard as authority figures, like museums and galleries. I think that most people don't think to question the authenticity of an artifact or artwork simply because it is on display in one of these institutions. It is also interesting to consider how the meaning of an artwork changes depending on how it's presented. Does having a projection or photograph of a painting change it's meaning or do we view it the same way as the original? How does reproducing an artwork influence the artist's original intention for their work?
A brilliant man who has written tons of pieces on modernity and the evolution and lifespan of applied and recorded knowledge. It makes sense that his work would find his way into this article.
Here, context adds to the meaning of the "preserved object" (in this case, the "object" being the play).
In these paragraphs, we can see the context the object is displayed in shaping the perception of the object itself, even if nothing has technically been done to change the "original".
An original becomes valuable perhaps precisely because there are copies of it.  If an alien was walking through the Louvre and saw the Mona Lisa, they might think it's nice but nothing that special - just another painting among hundreds of paintings. But for us... It's the MONA LISA! It's this ubiquitious icon, it's everywhere!   To give a slightly more oblique example... I was rewatching Lord of the Rings a few years ago, and I got to the part where Boromir says "One does not simply WALK into Mordor" and it just completely cracked me up. Obviously in itself the line is not anything special. But because it has been subject to countless memetic reproductions, it takes on a new significance. In fact, it becomes a little jarring to see it in its original context. XD 
Facsimiles are useful because they bring art to people who are unable to access art galleries of travel to see the original. Aura in art is not necessarily important because art can be remade, remixed and recreated. 
"-Argument about if originality really is the focal point of making something worth be reproduced. 	-Discussion if originality is as important today as it was in the past? I think even more so, often movie producers, musicians and writers strive to create "
#NAME?
I think this might be because of the value society places on history, especially artifacts, and its preservation. Original art, like the example of the Mona Lisa, tends to be regarded as "thought evoking" and extremely overrated in my opinion. It's this regard that has lead to preservation of pieces that show a development of skill in tangible art. Things like performance art are often immaterial, in so far as a dance can't be grasped like a painting could. Performance art also happens within time, whereas a painting can be seen more of a physical snapshot. Although like the instance of the play "King Lear" the (re)production of it is a different kind of preservation. If anything performing arts are as much about the historical context that it would have been created in as it is about authentically reproducing it in the present. (Whatever "authenticity" may mean...) 
This concept is extremely fascinating. This text is suggesting that without reproductions or copies then perhaps the original would not have as much value. People are reproducing because they want it or have a need for this object. Thus, these reproductions result in creating more passion or lust for this original piece. Even if it is a reproduction the value is not the same because of this "mystical quality" that originals have.
This reminds me of the Grimms' Fariy Tales, which were collected, transcribed and created from folk stories by the Brothers Grimm. Although the children's movies based on these fairy tales are translations, not copies of the stories, I wonder if the Grimms' story about Briar Rose is valued more than Disney's Sleeping Beauty. 
An "original only in name" is an interesting concept. This pseudo-original is the closest that they have to an original and is accepted as the original, but is not the original painting. What constitutes the original and why is it acceptable to call this painting the original? I think it is also interesting that the author of this article references the importance of public opinion in this quotation. How and when does public opinion change accepted standards and definitions? I feel like most people would not realize that this painting is not the original because of the trust put into museums, art galleries and other prestigious institutions. 
Incredibly complicated and advanced technology that is available that i was never aware of. very fascinating.
Interesting distance between the author and the "contemporary masses."  
I don't really understand what this means. What is meant by the "quality of its presence"? Authenticity? And why is nature not vulnerable to depreciated authenticity?
This sentence is important, especially given the tone of the writing (which is wary of the age of mechanical reproductions), because it shows reproduction as a neutral act. The uniqueness of an object is traded for its plurality, and this is not inherently bad. Reproductions allow an object to be more widely consumed. The aura may be lost, but its enjoyment by an audience is much greater. (quality vs quantity?)
These two examples really illustrate his point. The language is a little difficult in this reading, but the examples make clear the point- copies can escape their originals, travel where they cannot or do not, and create their own meanings and contexts for what they simulate/ represent.
With the different levels of learning used people can still use the same form of information or object to work on different techniuques
I will connect this passage to my project on Terry Fox. The symbolic meaning of the iconic images of Terry Fox on his Marathon of Hope have helped immortalize Fox's effort in trying to find a cure to cancer.   
Art will always be replication based on the senses of the artist during the construction of the art piece.  Context is what gives a replication meaning, and therefore if the contextual space and time of the thing being replicated through art remains the same, then it should not matter which is the original replication.  
I really like Arnheim. He talks a lot about order and entropy, especially in art and in nature. I think a lot of what he said could be applied to how we think about DH and how it's viewed as a whole.
Perhaps this is very surface-level and not using the word in the same sense Benjamin is here, but this strikes me as interesting as I feel like since his writing this, art has often been produced specifically for the purposes of "distracted engagement" - think "muzak", things that are only meant to be placed in the background.
No longer necessarily true with the advances in digital technology. Not that digital recreation is without its own difficulties. A concept which I'm sure we will be familiar with by the end of this course. 
This raises an interesting point on modern art and what constitutes an original or authentic piece of work. 
I feel that reproductions do not affect the original as severely as the passage suggests, at least not in today's world. There may be thousands of reproductions of famous artworks hanging as posters in peoples homes, but this does not discourage them from travelling to museums to see the original.  However, this point is only considering the social value of a work and not whether reproductions affect the original works' monetary value.  
I like the idea that the individual history of a work can add value to a piece. Historical value doesn't just come from the time and place that the original was created but from the significance of its ownership and people's emotional connection to them. Even a reproduction can have value if it was owned by an important person or if it appeared in a significant time or place.  
Analogous to my annotation on sound recording, this gives insight into the way the director and cinematographer come to be seen as artists for their respective contributions to the mediated product the audience engages with.
This reminds me of the art of recording music; at the outset, the purpose of a record would have been simply to capture a performance for the reproducibility of that specific performance. But somewhere along the way, those involved in the recording process realized that they could also have a massive impact on the way the masses would hear the music they were recording - in some cases, more than the artist being recorded. Thus the "producers" gained a new status as artists in their own right.
I know this is a translation so it might not be exact, but does anyone have any idea as to whether this is meant in the same sense as Marx's "use value"?
Is this necessarily true? Do we see transitoriness as being linked to reproducibility in our current age? I would assume the opposite to some degree, that if something today is reproducible, it is "preserved" to some extent and therefore not completely transitory.
Probably goes without saying, but this strikes me as rather prophetic in terms of how we consume media right now.
The image of the actor in the camera or of yourself in the mirror is a replication of yourself in the world. It's representative of yourself but isn't you.
This passage sums a point being made in the article; as the technological ability to replicate becomes more effortless, the significance of the original becomes less important.  With current new technologies such as VR providing people with the feeling of physically being in the presence of major historical monuments from the comfort of their living room, the actual awestruck emotion that one feels when experiencing the original historical monument is lessened as they have seen it in  many detailed copies prior to first visiting it in person.  The great deal of effort once needed to replicate a great historic object, is now replaced with mechanical reproduction that takes less effort and provides greater detailed copies.  This over-saturates the true significance of the object by having copies of it easily available to anyone who wishes to see them.
You could also go further and say that depending on the type of culture, art can have a different meaning. I say this because the next point discusses an example with the statue of Venus and how it was percieved by the Greeks, and the individuals from the Middle Ages. 
Very interesting part of passage. Basically says that as humans develop over centuries, so does our perception of certain things which is a very true statement in itself. You see many examples of this in the world today when you compare it to the historical world.
Good that someone else picked up on this point. It's important to know and acts as the premise for the reading as well.
This concept allows creators (of literature, film, art, etc) to grasp or just acknowledge the fact that in this digital age the audience is much larger. The world is much more connected and therefore the audience is only a keyboard away with their responses. 
Time and space are two very important aspects within history as well as digital crafting. Reproductions are not items that exist within the original sphere where they were intended to exist. When the space in which they exist changes then this artefact changes as well
This phrase stands out because this exactly what we are going to do within the course. We are going to reproduce something that will then represent something new.
Although the aura of a performer cannot be replicated, film has its own sort of aura, created through tone and sound.The aura of a film shapes the story in a different, although not necessarily better, way to create a new translation of the subject. I think a film based off a play is more of a translation of that play than a reproduction of it because the aura of its performers cannot be replicated and, therefore, the medium must be adapted to fill that void. 
I find this interesting because it suggests that each object, reproduction or not, has its own unique existence and narrative. For example, x-rays have recently been finding different images under famous paintings that were painted over. What is underneath can suggest a different purpose or aspect of the painting that might otherwise not be obtained without the original. 
I think a work of art in itself is a reproduction or translation of a feeling, object, experience or something else into a medium which is considered art. An artist interprets a feeling or object and creates this translation. 
This seems to be a reintroduction of man-made art to cult status. Paintings were only made for specific purposes, not for collective experience anymore. 
I always forget how intertwined German Romanticism is with Plato's allegory of the cave until I read lines like this... Really this whole paragraph.
Dadaism often involved the critique and protest of the realities of society or politics. Similarly, we see this in forms of television and movies today.
I can see why others would highlight this as well. It brings some deep thought to the table; as a result, it makes the reader question what 'art' is, and why the author believes it has always been reproducible.
Interesting statement and comparison between art in the 19th century and how its perception changed; not BECAUSE of photography but because people just weren't as interested in it anymore. (at least, i THINK that is what the author is saying?) It is contradictory to the commonly known narrative, that people no longer cared for photo-realistic paintings because photography wasn't an option.
#NAME?
I don't know how this directly applies to early photographic portraiture considering the shutter speed was so slow that subjects were required to remain motionless and emotionless.
why portraits AND post mortem photography became so popular in the Victorian era amidst the advent of photography. 
Seems analogous to the rejection of impressionist painters.
The context determines why and how a work of art is venerated.
The context determines why and how a work of art is venerated.
The value of an item or artwork is largely derived from the context in which it is created. Many works are valued for their age more so that their actual aesthetic appeal. This is why recreations of older works are not worth much. While they look the same, they were not made by the same person, or in the same time period as the original.
Debatable statement that the author justifies in the following paragraph. Art = ability to be reproduced.
??????????????
Depictions/reproductions in this manner are creating representations of the original work, rather than purporting to be the original
The fact art is available to all rather than the rich means it's interpreted from more diverse perspectives - broadens the knowledge that can be acquired without leaving home
Advent of printing press and other ways of rapidly reproducing art + text meant art became more accessible to people who were not the elite/rich
In order for humanities fields to benefit and grow from new technology, people within that field need to acknowledge its ability to innovate the discipline. There are still areas of study where people are resistant to any change, but in order to allow for new ideas they must be open to new technology. 
Similar to his point before, this ease encourages more "creativity" within the game genre, as more people are able to turn their ideas into a product(or virtual product anyways). Of course, some are better than others...
With how a majority of people presenting history are currently operating, by not utilising new tech and instead opting for the "conventional," this is likely one of the best ways to push innovation as a longer-term investment by exposing it to younger audiences.
I believe this to be incredibly important. The further our technology grows, the more necessary it is to adapt. Things are moving at an exponential rate, the sooner that archaeology comes to terms and embraces technology, the sooner that innovations take place. 
It is here perhaps important to remember that the context in which something is created is most likely going to be different from the following contexts in which that thing will be presented and consumed.
This has always bothered me about humanities courses and how just because they are "arts" that they just seem to allow for technology to be used (perhaps not even fully understood) in a way that makes it seem as if the vetting process was already done by someone else who understands the technology better. This of course is a problem because someone who understands how something digital works, may not understand practical application, especially in terms of archeology, and vice versa.

One of the interesting things I noticed when I started really getting into the digital was just _how much_ tacit knowledge, hidden knowledge, creative knowledge existed. Uncovering and communicating this work to 'outsiders' is one of my major public functions...
why are we so interested in making works that imitate reality, so much so that anything from the real work such as human hands would break this illusion? 
This is an interesting perspective about digital art that I am starting to agree with the more I work on the assignment.  At first I was firm on the idea that digital technology limited the talent needed to produce art and led to artistic creations being over-saturated in our society.  I still hold somewhat to this belief, however since working on a 3D model for this assignment, I now see the tremendous skill needed to create digital art and it has opened my eyes to the creative potential that digital technology provides the artist.
This idea makes sense in that, depending on the person viewing and the time period, etc. the artworks can be seen in many different ways.
This idea of de-humanizing something makes sense when they are talking about 3D imaging, and making historical monument available through a Virtual 3D viewing, because like everything else that is digitized, as much as the digitizer may be trying to stay neutral in their views of the object or monument, you are still seeing it through their view and not your own. This could lead you to thinking about something differently than if you were to see it first hand, and you could analyze it in your own way. 
I really like this idea, because I find it rings true for me personally. As much as reproductions of something make it more accessible to so many more people, still being able to see the original in all of it's glory is what makes you truly appreciate the creativity.
Sums up really well the entire point of this segment. As great as technology is, its pointless if we cannot use it in a meaningful way. Meaningful itself is subjective though. May seem like a challenge, but the possibilities are really limitless! It'll be exciting to see not only what we do in this class but how the digital history world evolves over the next few years!
Having the technology is one thing, being able to use/present it successfully is another. Reoccurring issue...
Really interesting cause/effect. Kind of reminds me of the video game world and its striving for "realistic" graphics above all else. Ends up compelling gameplay/stories/character/actual creativity is more important (who knew) and now we have a thriving indie community in addition to AAA titles. 
Interesting bringing up the pros and cons of mass production. Makes you question what is "real" and what is "inauthentic" and whether or not it matters. Important to think about when it comes to making digital copies/3d prints
This is an interesting idea which greatly appeals to me. I can understand that 3D visualizations are an image essentially created by someone, but I feel they are more closely related to photography and animation as they are artworks created through the use of machinery or technology. 
These sound really cool, I am happy that there is still the ability to express creativity within digital visualizations. 
The value of human creativity is incredibly high, especially when it comes to an increasingly technological world, as it is increasingly difficult to express creativity when many discourage its necessity and seek to diminish it in everyday society. Thus re-introducing it is very important. 
This is an interesting concept. If there is no way of distinguishing virtual reality from real life, at what point does the virtual reality become 'too real' or is there even a limit? Are the artists therefore celebrated for creating an artwork which isn't recognizably an artwork?
This is especially true when it comes to abstract art. People often look at abstract art and think "well i could have done that", but they didn't. Even though the finished product looks like something anyone could physically achieve (in most cases), it takes a special kind of creativity to actually think of the original idea then turn it into reality. I think this is why so many non-artists are drawn to abstract art and why we value the artists creativity. People may not relate to the art as a finished product but they can relate to their own capability to accomplishing something similar.  
I would like to add to your point that it is, perhaps, an individual's ability to freely interpret  and connect with the creative and the abstract that explains part of the value of art. 
You make an interesting point. In oral tradition, the changes made to the story by each person and their own interpretation of the story do create subjectivity in the practice. However, I think that oral tradition can also be an objective practice, in a sense, as the original storyteller's voice can often be lost as the story is passed from one person to another. In gathering different stories, one can create an idea of objectivity through the amalgamations of the different versions of the same story. 
I find it interesting that what is embodied is "an idea of objectivity".  I wonder whether it is the *idea* of objectivity because true objectivity can never be achieved, because they are not aiming to achieve objectivity, but rather the appearance of it, or both. 
Perhaps it's a shallow observation, but this starts to sound a little like Judith Butlers "performativity"...
This is, in one way, an example of what I pointed out in my previous comment: if you set specific parameters for a program to accomplish a task that don't allow for much creativity, it could be seen as akin to an artist limiting their technique to a "formula" that is supposed to produce only one type of representation. Again, the machines do the work, but humans still design the machines.
And what's interesting here is that we often assume that because an artistic process is "mechanized" or "digitalized" or makes use of newer technology, there's something "less human" about it...but we shouldn't forget that there's almost always a human designing the process and setting the boundaries for the machine's work. Perhaps more emphasis needs to be placed on this?
There's something ironic about this, considering that a lot of long-running "heritage" traditions - before the age of archiving everything - were passed along by "word of mouth" or cultural performances that necessarily involved the mediation of another's action in the process.
There are a lot of issues in language to language translation when it comes to direct translations vs translations that get to the intended meaning of something but doesn't necessarily reflect the actual words being used. I imagine there are similar issues when it comes to translating the physical into the digital. Just because something looks identical to the original doesn't mean it necessarily conveys the meaning or intent behind the original.
This passage beautifully articulates why abstract art (and really, an art that isn't realism) is so highly regarded and valued by many  today, despite how others remain skeptical or refuse to understand. Sometimes neither the skill nor the time put into an artwork is what makes it valuable, but the creativity and the message of the artist is what makes it unique and important. 
Amateur vs professional reproductions on the topic of heritage.  Applications to both students and actual historians who wish to give an accurate representation of what they're researching.
For me personally, its increasing interesting to have the ability to replicate something either huge or ancient that we may see in a museum and have it made small enough to analyze in the palm of my hand. 
Folks, if you open the pdf in the browser, you can annotated the pdf directly and the rest of us can see it.
why "performing"? A really interesting turn-of-phrase
I think this is a great summary of the heart of the ACCORD mandate, not to "professionalize" more people, or increase passive interest- but to make the whole of archaeology more accessible. The self-reflection here is great, and I think other areas of history could benefit from checking inherent bias. I also appreciate that technology was not made a barrier to the community, because concerted efforts for inclusion made the actual use of equipment less of a priority.
It is important to think about what happens to a digital project after being completed, is it continually used or is it forgotten? Yes the process is equally or more significant than the end result, but that should't result in the disregard of the project when it's finished. 
This is the conclusions page so it's a lot of repeating points, but I like how in the end despite their vastly different approaches to the project they agreed with the process over result mentality. Story of this course!
I know this was already annotated but I'm gonna annotate it again just because it's such a great point. 
It might be getting old, but I will harp again on my point about the fact that machines don't just do work - people program them to do work, thereby taking responsibility and action in the process.
Things to keep in mind when developing our own projects. 
Human emotion does play a significant role in the status we assign to certain places and things. In determining which monuments to preserve, the communities were forced to acknowledge their own emotional attachments to certain things. I think that acknowledging this human element in both digital history and history as a whole is important for understanding why we deem certain historical things more important than others. 
This is an interesting term, as I used to dance and had never heard of this before. 
paradata!!!!
I'm glad they brought up this story. In a previous page I mentioned how its limiting to just vote on significant monuments. Just because the Gallipoli monument was not well known or significant to the others in the group, did not mean it wasn't significant. I'm glad this one guy was able to bring new meaning and recognition to this monument! (Incidentally this reflects my own visit to Gallipoli without actually knowing what it was or why I was going, only to be educated on how important it was both to the ANZACs and the Turks (and Churchill too, incidentally))
Furthering the point of the importance of the process. I agree that HOW something was made is just as important as the end result. This is true not only in digital history but traditionally too. Half the allure of the pyramids, for example, is trying to figure out how they made it. In the future, they'll probably be far more interested in how we were making 3d scans than the scans themselves (as they presumably will have far superior scanning/copying technology to make better scans themselves)
Are the 3D features not working for anybody else as well?? I'm slightly disappointed. 
Demonstrates how even though they were not engaging with any artifacts, the environment and the group facilitated the exchange of stories, which is way of commemoration itself.  
This seems to be an important mindset to have when working on any project, but especially in terms of digital humanities work. Allowing the process to take precedence removes a great deal of stress regarding the final product, and facilitates more possible outcomes. 
Back to the point in chapter 1, inverted where the results of the "mass production" attempt is more engaging than the "real" object. Who would have thought?
Interesting statement. Their attitude allowed them to have a different take and approach on the project. 
This reminds me of the difference between thinking of history temporally vs. thinking about it spatially.
This connection with artists seems to be important for spotting points of similarity in technique; it allows us to make the scanning process more "artistic" and "human".

"Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is a new imaging technique that creates hyper-realistic digital surrogates that are interactively controlled by the viewer. This new method is based upon the synthesis of multiple digital images of a subject in a fixed position collected from a fixed camera position." According to:  https://www.si.edu/MCIImagingStudio/RTI
More about the process than the end result. Again, the emotional element wins over the cold mechanical aspects of the project in terms of importance. 
In the words of Tim Gunn, "Make it work!". Another reminder not to let a particularly tough challenge get in our way. Good for them for sticking with the project for the community's sake!
I find that this is true with most things, if you are made to play an active role in something you are more emotionally invested in its outcome. 
Quite often a place or object becomes defined by its history, allowing history to shape our understanding of it and determine the value placed upon it. 
I think being able to "feel" and to spiritually connect is important. However, I also wonder how the ability to feel during the design process translates to the final product. To what extent will those who have only the final product to observe be able to spiritually connect to that heritage?
I wonder if this is a recurring theme in 3D modeling, the idea that it is better to model things thoroughly to get that 'feel' of how something really is. Just how important is that 'feel' compared to easier, cheaper methods of scanning.  
I think the idea of collaboration between Art and Humanities, and now digital humanities, is really important to the infrastructure of both disciplines because it really allows people to take in not only historical and cultural information such as stories, but also to appreciate and experience the artistic abilities of people from many different parts of the world, and many different generations.  
if you files do not have all of the information in the metadata, you can use these and the exiftool to change/add the information into it
Similar to what I mentioned in my previous comment...when one challenge is overcome, the creator will move to the next.
I would actually disagree with this statement; making the executive part of the work "too easy" will never fully solve the problem of creation that makes creation so interesting in the first place. If you make one part too easy, it's true that there will be less thought put into *that aspect of it*, but then the creator in question will simply move on to tackle a different aspect more in-depth than they may have been able to prior to whatever technological advancement brought about this circumstance in the first place.
Here we see reference to the inevitable transformation of information and content as it moves between media over time.
It kind of seems odd to label them as alternative, as 3D printing and interactive technology becomes more and accessible. But I guess maybe conservatism goes with a profession about old things.
I don't think there's a way for me to like your comment but this is the best reaction to an academic reading I've ever seen in my entire life.
Personally I hope digital humanities can move away from formal academia - while there's definitely value in learning and creating within the structure of a university, it creates this sense that things created in a university are inherently "better" than something created by a smart person who didn't have the opportunity to attend "higher" education.
Something your comment made me consider: what kind of information do we miss out on when we don't get to experience the physicality of an artefact? Digitizing books and other historical objects is really awesome for opening up access and in some ways removing some of the hierarchical nature of academia, but what do we lose by not getting to see something with our own eyes or touching it with our hands? 
I once went to a search engine optimization session led by Google and one of the things they emphasized was optimizing websites for mobile users. If your site isn't optimized for mobile, people are much more likely to try another site for the same thing. Conversely, mobile users were much more likely to make impulse purchases on a mobile optimized site.   For me this quote is about fixing the flaws with the way information is delivered to us so we don't have to stop tinkering with the delivery system and get down into the nitty gritty of the information we're getting. 
By not requiring someone to engage with the material they're using to create with, Morris is arguing this devalues the end product. A lot more thought and consideration is put into say, a handmade textile versus something made on a mechanized loom. While a lot of consideration might be put into the initial design, once the thread hits the loom there's no thought or consideration being put into the work. It's why people still pay to see live concerts instead of being content to just sit at home listening to a recording. The act of creation is what gives something value. The disposable culture we live in today is fed by the fact we don't value machine made materials the same way we cherish the handmade.
It is indeed... ![](http://www.bountyfishing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/fangtooth-fish1.jpg)
Importance of teaching digital humanities and digital humanities profs! 
This entire paragraph has been questions, which is effective in letting the reader imagine the potential for digital humanities.  
Echoing Rachel here, but definitely reflects the nature of the course. Have to learn to accept "failures", because failures are only truly failures if we learn nothing from it.
When you feel guilty for clicking away from websites with bad UX design... Interesting as a problem we don't tend to think about but I can see why this would be a big problem.
Love this quote! In addition to what other have already said, it kind of reminds me of the quote "You have enemies? Good. It means you stood up for something" in the sense that, counterintutively, resistance does not always have to be a bad thing. Resistance to new ideas does not mean they're bad ideas!
I do believe that it is nice that so many different books are and writings are now digitized and you can read them from anywhere in the world. The unfortunate downside of this though is that you do not get the same feeling from reading a book online as you would from holding the book in it's original form.
This is an interesting idea looking at it from today's perspective. With so many forms of art being digitized in today's society, with people able to paint beautiful pictures on a tablet without even having to lift a brush, does take a way from that old art form. With this said though, it does allow for so many more forms of art to emerge which is great in it's own sense.
It is interesting to see how his idea of "resistance in the material" came about when talking about the typewriter, as this at the time, from what I understand, was supposed to making writing down notes or letters a more free flowing and easy task. 
New advances in technology is great, but it is never perfect from the first try. Updates, re-making, and re-interpretation is required in order for it to useful, and relevant, or for it to be used for  a new purpose. (IE. From the multiple reinventions of the kiln in order to be more efficient or smelt different metals, to computer software updates so that programs can keeps up or offer new applications.)
I think that in principle, this is an issue that many people have faced and can relate to; the vision you had in your head for whatever project did not result in the way you expected for reasons you could not have foreseen. Kind of relates back to what we learnt in the first class - that failure allows us to learn.
Often I think the resistance from the material- or even expanding to a larger view than material but rather resistance from let's say, the public - is important. If things were smooth sailing at all times then often people would begin to stop double, triple checking their work. They may not work as hard  to refine their process when they know it will always succeed. Just like what @scellerington mentioned, this quote represents what this course will be about. We are made to fail but what we do with this failure is how we will succeed.
This quote demonstrates what i believe we'll be dealing with lots in this course. Failure is certain, but that is just a part of success. Art takes time, as does working on new things. 
I think it's important to acknowledge the shift in scholarly style that digital humanities provides. Embracing collaboration and allowing for humanities work to evolve with the new technological times helps set it apart from previous scholarship. 
I like this sentiment a lot, that the process and errors encountered help the overall tool or project being made. 
I really like this connection being established between digital humanities and art. The quotation itself emphasizes the importance of the process within digital humanities, which is just as important if not more so than the end result. 
The divide between producing a physical thing versus writing a paper is interesting. The humanities generally produces words only, while digital humanities is able to take those words and also produce things which seem more tangible. I find this distinction very interesting. 
I would have to agree with you on that one. I think society is and should be just as concerned with the past as we are with the future.
I find it interesting how the representation of history becomes unimportant in comparison to the experience of history and the focus on the future. Our society is very future-oriented, seeking innovation and development; so it makes sense that we care more about the experience than the representation.  Nevertheless, I do not agree that we no longer concerned about what has happened. I think that the past informs the future.
This is an interesting way to look at history. However, I do not really understand Kant's idea of "historical eventfulness."
I wonder how accurate collective memories will be when not dependent on centralized institutions. Will the bodies that shape these memories have more or less of an agenda than a centralized institution might have? And how would one monitor the motives and accuracy of an agenda of a collective memory? I think this change would promote innovation, but I also worry about trolls and credibility. 
Interesting. I never thought about video games in the context of how they represent historical events. While it is sometimes argued that video games desensitize people to violence, video games also expose people to historical events in an interactive fashion and can confront people with the realities and consequences of the violence of those events. Assassin's Creed also explores historical events, although perhaps in a way that is less realistic than the author of this article wishes to discuss. Video games can make history feel real in the way that texts and artifacts cannot. 
Try annotating this version of the Fogu article folks.
Super fascinating comparison!
Again, the game uses historical characters, technologies, monuments, etc for the purpose of the game rather than to develop a historical understanding within the player . 
Movies "based" on history appear to be so real that it becomes hard to separate historical fact from  exaggerated Hollywood fiction. When watching movies "based on a true story" i always find myself googling the event afterwards to see which aspects were actually true.
But are virtual memories worth it if those memories are not accurate?
I think this is a very interesting point to make. My initial reaction to the concept of the video game was honestly shock and disgust that a virtual reality game would be made on the topic of such an atrocity (theoretically, of course.). But this passage calls into question our perceptions of history. Perhaps this concept is so shocking because of holocaust's relative immediacy and relevance still today. However it is easy to make video games about other violent atrocities in the distant past because we are more removed from that reality, and the facts are more easily twisted. 
This is an interesting and new perspective for me. As a history major and a fan of *Civilization *myself,  I never thought of how the game portrays historical events to  other players who may not be familiar with the historical events or people who are represented. To me, the leaders are simply recognizable characters which make the game more interesting, however, for players who may not be well informed, they may take the characters and timeline to be accurate, when in fact it is not.  
This, I think, is another piece that should join the 'core'  [http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/programming-forgetting-new-hacker-ethic/](http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/programming-forgetting-new-hacker-ethic/)

I really like this approach to the course, as it eases my worries about any lack of knowledge with technology and allows me to learn from any mistakes I will make.
I am very excited to have this course as it seemed to be very different from the usual reading and essay classes. However, I feel if I am able to get through this course, I will be able to learn alot more interesting and useful information. I am most worried about the steep learning curve especially if it requires to create anything digital with an alternative program which I have never used before.
