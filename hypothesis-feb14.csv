In the context of that class, we were talking about the way science fiction developed but it applies to conservation too. In science fiction, the types of technological advancements that are incorporated into the ""future"" that's presented is a reflection of what we see in our present today.   In the context of archaeology and conservation, it's easy to think we're talking about the past, because what needs conservation work is things from the past. But when we choose to preserve items from the past, we are projecting present day values on it. We don't preserve items based on their value or worth when they were being used, we preserve based on their value or worth in today's society. When Pompeii was discovered, people only cared about statuary and it led to situations like the courtyard Professor Graham was trying to digitally restore that he showed us in class. However, today we think the entire place is valuable and are choosing to preserve more than just statues. "

It's relevant because of the way it's put together. The Afiara Quartet approached Canadian composers and had them compose pieces for them. Skratch Bastid then took the recorded versions of those pieces and remixed them. They then sent the remixed versions back to the original composers, who then wrote a response to the remix for the Afiara Quartet to play with the remixed version. Every time they perform it it's a little bit different because Skratch Bastid mixes it live and thus it sounds different every time. It's definitely an interesting way to look at music, especially classical music. I think a lot of people have this idea of classical music being very stoic and unapproachable, but I find Spin Cycle is very open and easier to digest because it's very clearly a dialogue between the very classical form of the quartet speaking to the very modern concept of scratch DJ and remixing.  If anyone is interested, the pieces they play in the video are: 2 Pop Songs on Antique Poems: No. 2, I Will Not Let You Go, composed by Dinuk Wijeratne Soul Searching, Pts. 1 & 2 (Skratch Bastid remix) Through the Invisible, composed by Dinuk Wijeratne [this is the piece Wijeratne composed in response to the remix]  I have a physical copy of the album, and it's also on Spotify if that's an app you use.

Performance art also happens within time, whereas a painting can be seen more of a physical snapshot.

People often look at abstract art and think ""well i could have done that"", but they didn't. Even though the finished product looks like something anyone could physically achieve (in most cases), it takes a special kind of creativity to actually think of the original idea then turn it into reality. I think this is why so many non-artists are drawn to abstract art and why we value the artists creativity. People may not relate to the art as a finished product but they can relate to their own capability to accomplishing something similar.  "

In oral tradition, the changes made to the story by each person and their own interpretation of the story do create subjectivity in the practice. However, I think that oral tradition can also be an objective practice, in a sense, as the original storyteller's voice can often be lost as the story is passed from one person to another. In gathering different stories, one can create an idea of objectivity through the amalgamations of the different versions of the same story. "

I never thought about video games in the context of how they represent historical events. While it is sometimes argued that video games desensitize people to violence, video games also expose people to historical events in an interactive fashion and can confront people with the realities and consequences of the violence of those events.
